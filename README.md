# This is an app made by four college students - Meghana Ganapathiraju
# UNC '19, Victoria Wong Duke '19, Taylor Wilson Duke '19, and Rachel Yuan UNC '19.
# Made for Android phones, this app was created and presented at Pearl Hacks
# within the span of 24 hours.
# The purpose of this app is to give you the weather of your location and
# suggest an outfit for the day, based on that location. The components were
# divided into three parts: getting the users location, which Meghana did; 
# getting the weather, which Rachel did; and giving outfit advice, which
# Victoria and Taylor did.
# We hope to expand on this app in the future.
